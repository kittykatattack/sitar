-------------------------------------------------

Here's what you need to do to get started:

*   Find a good teacher. It's almost impossible to learn properly without one. If you can't find a good teacher in your neighbourhood, consider doing an accelerated beginner's residential course and then continuing via internet-based lessons.
*   Listen to as much sitar music as you can. The Music section on this page will give you links to the essential sitar music you will love and learn from for an entire lifetime. If you're new to the sitar and Indian Classical music, immerse yourself in it, day and night, and you'll soon start to feel the magic.
*   Find the best instrument you can. Unless you really know sitars well, stick to a sitar by one of the best makers: Hiren Roy, Ibrahim Bashir or Rikhi Ram. They cost about as much as good quality guitar.
*   Practise at least an hour a day. In 5-7 years you'll be playing really well. If you want perform classical sitar professionally, commit 25 hours a week for 10 years, and go from there. Yes, it's worth it! The sitar is not a difficult instrument. It's extremely enriching to learn, and anyone can play it well with a bit of practise.

Software and gear [Learning sitar]
----------------------------------

*   [iTabla Pro](http://www.itablapro.com): Superb tabla and tanpura software for iOS devices (iPhone and iPad) that's infinitely configurable.
*   [Cleartune](http://www.bitcount.com): A software tuner for iOS devices that can accurately tune a sitar. Set the Temperament to Pythagorean Just and the Temperament Key to C# or D (whichever key your sitar is tuned to). Tune the Ga chikari string to about 20 cents less than what the tuner tells you. (You can't use a guitar tuner to tune a sitar, except for finding the root note, Sa (C# or D). That's because guitar tuners are calibrated to Equal Temperament, which is a compromise tuning system for harmony based music.)
*   [Practice Pro](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/practice-pro/id405586401?mt=8): iOS software that lets you  slow down and loop sections of recordings for transcription and learning.

Sheet Music [Music]
------------------

If you're looking for sheet music in western music notation for a sitar/guitar duet, you'll find it here:

* [Summer's End](pdf/Summers_End.pdf): Based on Raag Hamamsadvhani (The Song of the Swan) in the key of D. Here's a [midi reference track](midi/Summers_End.midi). 
* [In Groves of Wild Almond](pdf/In_Groves_Of_Wild_Almond.pdf): Based on Raag Kafi in the key of D. Here's a [midi reference track](midi/In_Groves_Of_Wild_Almond.midi). 

Both pieces were written by Rex van der Spuy, and can be played with improvised tabla accomaniment. Although they were originally written for sitar and guitar, they could work as a duet for any melody instruments. Violin and flute would sound nice!

Buying a sitar [Instruments]
----------------------------

If you're looking to buy a sitar, the following dealers are the best. Sitar.co has used all of them.

*   [Delhi Music Stores](http://www.indianmusicalinstruments.com/). DMS will ship anywhere in the world with FedEx. Ask for their Ibrahim Bashir sitars.
*   [Rain City Music](http://www.sitar-tabla.com/). All their stock is personally curated by the owner, Lars Jacobsen, from the best instruments available.
*   [Ali Akbar College of Music Store](http://www.aacm.org/shop/). A great place to buy Hiren Roy and Rikhi Ram sitars, and the best place to order strings.
*   [Tony Karasek](http://www.karaseksound.com). Tony is a legend. If your sitar needs fixing, and you're not in India, send it to Tony. He also specializes in custom Delrin sitar bridges that don't require any maintenance. Want a custom made sitar of the highest quality? Tony will make one for you. Check out his [website](http://www.karaseksound.com) or [send him an email](horsley42@gmail.com).

Which sitar should you buy? Hiren Roy sitars are the best available.  They have a unique, magical tone and are truly in a class of their own. Even though the average Hiren Roy currently costs about $2,500, they hold their value. If you need to, you'll be able to sell it for the same price, or at a profit. Even if you're a student just starting to learn, do yourself a favour and get a Hiren Roy!  They're easier to play and control and much more responsive than any other sitar on the market. 

If you can't find a Hiren Roy, you might be lucky and find an old Kanai Lal and Brother sitar, although they're very rare. They sound as good and are probably even better made than Hiren Roy. Kanai Lal and Brother were actively making sitars between about 1950 to 1970. (Note: Kanai Lal and Brother sitars are not in any way connected to currently manufactured "Kanai Lal" sitars, which are far inferior.) An early 60's Kanai Lal and Brother sitar owned by my first sitar teacher is to this day still the best sounding sitar I've ever heard.

Third up: Rihki Ram. However, make sure it was made before 1974. The early Rikhi Ram sitars were of equal quality to Hiren Roy or Kanai Lal and Brother, but their quality plummeted after 1974. 

If you're not able to find or afford any of the sitars above, consider a reasonably priced modern sitar made by Ibrahim Bashir or Waseem Sitarmaker. Both of these makers produce good quality instruments, and occasionally exceptional ones. They generally don't have that extra dimension of tone that you find in a Hiren Roy or Kanai Lal and Brother, but they're well made and finished. And, you might get lucky end up with a real gem.
