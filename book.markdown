About learning to play the sitar [Learning sitar]
-------------------------------------------------

Here's what you need to do to get started:

*   Find a good teacher. It's almost impossible to learn properly without one. If you can't find a good teacher in your neighbourhood, consider doing an accelerated beginner's residential course and then continuing via internet-based lessons.
*   Listen to as much sitar music as you can. The Music section on this page will give you links to the essential sitar music you will love and learn from for an entire lifetime. If you're new to the sitar and Indian Classical music, immerse yourself in it, day and night, and you'll soon start to feel the magic.
*   Find the best instrument you can. Unless you really know sitars well, stick to a sitar by one of the best makers: Hiren Roy, Ibrahim Bashir or Rikhi Ram. They cost about as much as good quality guitar.
*   Practise at least an hour a day. In 5-7 years you'll be playing really well. If you want perform classical sitar professionally, commit 25 hours a week for 10 years, and go from there. Yes, it's worth it! The sitar is not a difficult instrument. It's extremely enriching to learn, and anyone can play it well with a bit of practise.

  Remove all the tuning beads from your sitar and add these fine
  tuners to all 6 (or 7) of your main playing strings. Prepare to
  enter Sitar Tuning Nirvana! They solve all the tuning headaches from
  having to struggle with friction pegs. Unlike other violin fine
  tuners, "Suzuki style" tuners attach directly to the strings and
  don't require a supporting bridge or any modification to the sitar.
  They can sometimes be difficult to find, but try your luck at Amazon
  and Ebay.[Lemuel Violins](https://www.violins.ca/accessories/fine_tuners.html) in Canada seems to have consistent
  stock, and is usually where I order mine from (Lemuel Violins ships
  internationally.) Wittner is the best brand on the market, and won't rust or jam. 

###Microphones and pickups for recording and performing

The [Senheizer MD421
Microphone](http://en-us.sennheiser.com/recording-microphone-broadcasting-applications-md-421-ii)
is possibly the best microphone ever made. And certainly, it's the best for
recording a sitar in a studio or amplifying it on stage. Why? It's like an acoustic mirror: it's warm, clear, totally transparent, and sensitive enough to pick up the complexity, detail and wide dynamic tonal range of a sitar. It's also the only microphone I've ever used in which the recording didn't require EQ, compression or reverb to add body and presence to the tone - it's perfect right out of the box. If your playing sounds bad through an MD421 - it's because your playing is bad! 

As a bonus, the MD421 is also completely resistant to feedback on stage, so you can use it in most difficult on-stage sound situations where you would otherwise need a pickup. The Senheizer MD421 is the only microphone you'll ever need. Put it in your backpack and travel the world!

However, in *extremely* difficult live sound environments you *will* need a pickup (also known as a contact microphone). A pickup turns your acoustic sitar into an electric sitar. The [Schatten AD-01
Pickup](http://schattendesign.com/ad.htm) is the best available pickup for a sitar. In what kind of sound environment would you need one? The kind where you're playing with a live trance band on a tiny stage with a wall of speakers behind you blasting at 300db and thousands of screaming fans in front of you, some of whom might be jumping onto the stage or throwing things. In cases like that, a microphone is unusable - except perhaps as a form of self-defence. But the Schatten AD-01 will save the day. You can plug any electric guitar lead into it and play through an ordinary guitar amplifier or PA, without requiring any extra power or a pre-amp. Attach the pickup disk to the underside of the sitar's bridge (or on the tabli just under the sympathetic string bridge) with some "acoustic instrument pickup putty", like this [Schertler putty](http://elderly.com/new_instruments/names/schertler-putty-for-dyn-series-pickups--DYNPUT.htm). The sound is full, rich, saturated and the most natural sounding pickup I've used. And, zero feedback - ever. 

The disadvantage to a pickup, even a top-of-the-line one like the Schatten, is that you get a much flatter, less interesting, more two-dimensional sound than you with a good quality microphone
like the Senheizer. It's like the difference between a Rembrandt (the Senheizer) and a Warhol (The Schatten) But, in bad, noisy live sound situations like rock clubs, you're never going to hear that extra detail anyway. And the girl at the sound desk is probably going to have to EQ the sitar into a extremely narrow frequency range, effectively killing all the interesting tones, so that it mixes properly with the rest of the band. Your sitar will sound harsh and tinny - in other words: exactly as it should when playing in a rock club. So a pickup is just fine. Yes, you'll be using the divinely inspired Senheizer
MD421 microphone for almost all your live performing and recording work - but keep the Schatten pickup in your back pocket; you never know when that live trance band will come knocking at your door! Hey, don't be
surprised - they seem to like sitar players, and you'll have a lot of fun. 

###Electronic Tuners

The [Boss TU-80 Tuner](http://www.bossus.com/products/tu-80/) is one of the few electronic tuners that can accurately distinguish the sitar's main tone from the other complex overtones a sitar
produces. That means reliable, quick and accurate tuning with no back-talk. It just works. However, like most tuners, it's calibrated for [Equal Temperament, while the sitar uses Just Temperament](http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/scales.html). That's no problem: *you can use an Equal Temperament tuner, like the Boss TU-80, with a Just Temperament tuned instrument like a sitar*. How? You just have to make small adjustments for the sitar's Ga and Dha notes: 

- Tune natural Ga about 18 cents flat.
- Tune flat (komal) Ga about 18 cents
  sharp.
- Tune natural Dha about 16 cents flat.

That's it! Now your sitar will sound unbelievably and perfectly in tune!

[Peterson Tuners](https://www.petersontuners.com) are interesting because they are the only tuners on the market that can tune a sitar using Just Temperament. All these tuners have a "SIT Sweetener" setting. If you select it and then set the transpose value to +1 (for C sharp) or +2 (for D) you have a sitar-ready
tuner. Confusingly, but importantly: because of the transpose value, the tonic will display on the tuner as "C", even if the note you're tuning to is really C# (a transpose value of +1), or D (a transpose value of +2). However, having used Peterson Strobo HD tuner for more than a year, I recommend you don't use Peterson tuners! 

Why? Because all Peterson tuners I've used become confused by the sitar's complex harmonic overtones and can't find the main pitch: the wheel just spins and flickers most of the time. Also - *they're too
precise*. Peterson tuners can tune to 0.1 cent accuracy. That's great, nice job Peterson! But, a sitar (or *any* string instrument, for that matter) is too unstable to tune to anything more precise than 3 cent accuracy. You're always going to have a natural variability of +/- 3 cents. That's no problem - that variability is imperceptible to the human ear under most conditions. However, the Peterson tuner will try and guide you to tune to the impossibly unattainable 0.1 cent accuracy. No matter how hard you try, every note you try to tune will will always appear to be slightly too sharp, or slightly too flat, according to the scientific, laboratory tested conditions under which Peterson calibrates its tuners to sub-atomic accuracy. This will drive you to the brink of madness! And, what's worse, it will trick your mind into thinking your sitar is horribly out of tune, when in fact it's perfectly in-tune.

As a curiosity-driven deep dive into the world of Just Temperament tuning, go a ahead and try a Peterson (the [iStroboSoft](https://www.petersontuners.com/products/istrobosoft/) for iOS and Android devices is probably the best one.) It's interesting! 

However, for the practical day-to-day job of tuning your sitar, just stick with the good old Boss TU-80 and adjust for the Ga and Dha notes as I've described. Your sitar will sound glorious!

Buying a sitar [Instruments]
----------------------------

If you're looking to buy a sitar, strings or accessories, the following dealers are the best. Sitar.co has used all of them.

- [Rain City Music](http://www.sitar-tabla.com/). As of 2015, this is best place in
  the world to buy a new sitar, period. And, it's the *only* place I can
  unreservedly recommend. If you're looking for a real
  instrument, not a just decorative item called a "sitar", Rain City Music
  is the only place to seriously consider buying from. All their stock
  is personally and lovingly and curated
  by the owner, Lars Jacobsen, from the best instruments available in
  India. All the best sitars in India end up at Rain City Music. Every sitar Lars stocks is guaranteed to be a high quality,
  professionally made instrument, properly fitted and setup to be
  playable right out of the box. If
  you're not sure which sitar is best for you, write to Lars, tell
  him your needs and he'll point you in the right direction. Don't
  worry about the cost: because these are the best sitars available,
  they'll retain their value for years and decades to come. That means, if you ever need to you'll be able to
  re-sell your sitar at cost, or probably a even make a small profit. Rain City
  Music ships everywhere in the world.
- [Delhi Music Stores](http://www.indianmusicalinstruments.com/). DMS will ship anywhere in the world with FedEx. Ask for their Ibrahim Bashir sitars.
- [Musician's Mall](http://www.musiciansmallusa.com) (Formerly the Ali
  Akbar Khan College Store). A new US based sitar and Indian
  instrument reseller. I haven't used them since their management
  changed, so can't yet recommend them. 
- [Tony Karasek](http://www.karaseksound.com). Tony is a legend. If
  your sitar needs fixing, and you're not in India, send it to Tony.
  He also specializes in custom Delrin sitar bridges that don't
  require any maintenance. Tony pioneered the technical breakthrough
  with Delrin bridges and they are a must-have for every
  sitar. Do you want a custom made sitar of the highest quality? Tony
  will make one for you! Check out his [website](http://www.karaseksound.com) or [send him an email](horsley42@gmail.com).

Which sitar should you buy? Hiren Roy sitars are currently the best available. They have a unique, magical tone and are truly in a class of their own. Even though the average Hiren Roy currently costs about $2,500, they hold their value and are a fantastic investment. Even if you're a student just starting to learn, do yourself a favour and get a Hiren Roy! They're easier to play and control and much more responsive than any other sitar on the market. 

UPDATE: However, as of early 2015, I can no longer recommend buying a new Hiren Roy. Quality of new instruments has plummeted, and the shop now produces as many duds as winners. Possibly the reason for this is that the head craftsman who worked in the Hiren Roy shop (and the person who actually made all the instruments himself) finally retired. So, sadly, it seems the Hiren Roy era for new sitars is finally really over. If you want a Hiren Roy, it will now have to be a second-hand one.

If you can't find a Hiren Roy, you might be lucky and find an old Kanai Lal and Brother sitar, although they're very rare. They sound as good and are probably even better made than Hiren Roy. Kanai Lal and
Brother were actively making sitars between about 1950 to 1970. (Note: Kanai Lal and Brother sitars are not in any way connected to currently manufactured "Kanai Lal" sitars - it's the "and Brother" you want.) An early 60's Kanai Lal and Brother sitar owned by my first sitar teacher is to this day still the best sounding sitar I've ever heard.

Third up: Rihki Ram. However, make sure it was made before 1974. The early Rikhi Ram sitars were of equal quality to Hiren Roy or Kanai Lal and Brother, but their quality plummeted after 1974. 

If you're not able to find or afford any of the sitars above, consider a reasonably priced modern sitar made by Ibrahim Bashir or Waseem Sitarmaker. Both of these makers produce good quality instruments, and
occasionally exceptional ones. They generally don't have that extra dimension of tone that you find in a Hiren Roy or Kanai Lal and Brother, but they're well made and finished. And, you might get lucky
end up with a real gem.

WARNING: Unless you live in India or have a well established network of reliable contacts there, **I strongly advise you to not to personally buy a sitar in India**. Not from a sitar maker, at a music shop, or through Ebay. Most sitars for sale in India are not sitars!. They are poorly made wooden decorative items that look like musical instruments called "sitars". They're sold in shops with the words "musical insturments for sale" in their windows. Don't be fooled! Unless you have the experience to know the difference, or are prepared to be extremely disappointed, do not take the risk. Finding a good sitar in India is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Yes, they exist. Will you find one? Probably not. If you're serious about finding a real, playable instrument, go through a reliable reseller, like [Rain City](http://www.raincitymusic.com) Music, who can guarantee that you get a real, high quality instrument at a fair price. The [internet is full of horror stories of people who not did not heed this advice](http://forums.chandrakantha.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=13578).
